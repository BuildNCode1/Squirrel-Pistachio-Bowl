# Squirrel-Pistachio-Bowl
This is a bowl for pistachios. First, you stack the two bowls (squirrel on top) then place your pistachios in the top bowl. As you deshell the seeds, you can pop the shells in the squirrel's mouth, where they will fall down into the second bowl, effectively separating the shells from the rest of the unshelled seeds.
